# CS230-RatGame
CS-230 Coursework. As part of the CS230 module (Software Developement) created with a team of 6.
An implementation of the Rats! window game using Java and JavaFX.

Tested on Java 11+
Adding the JavaFX library to the source code should be all thats required to run on your own machine.
If neccessary, these JavaFX modules need to be added aswell: controls, fxml, and media.
